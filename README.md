Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect the presence of brain tumors in MRI scan images. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and is trained on a dataset of MRI scans to classify them as either containing a tumor or not.

üåü Project Overview (The 5 Ws and 1 H)
This section breaks down the project to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of its purpose, scope, and implementation.

What is this project?
This project is a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), designed to classify brain MRI scans. It determines whether a given MRI image shows signs of a tumor, outputting a simple 'yes' or 'no' classification.

Why was this project created?
The primary motivation is to leverage AI to aid in the medical field. Early and accurate detection of brain tumors is vital for effective treatment. This project serves as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how deep learning can automate and enhance the accuracy of tumor detection, potentially serving as a valuable tool for radiologists and medical professionals. It also acts as an excellent educational resource for those learning about computer vision and medical image analysis.

Who is this project for?
This repository is intended for data science students, machine learning enthusiasts, researchers in medical imaging, and anyone interested in practical applications of deep learning. It provides a complete, end-to-end example of a computer vision project.

When/Where would this be used?
Currently, this model is designed for educational and research purposes. It can be run in any environment that supports Python and the required libraries, with Google Colab being the recommended platform due to its free access to GPUs. While not ready for clinical use, it demonstrates a methodology that, with further development and rigorous validation, could one day be integrated into diagnostic workflows.

How does it work?
The project follows a systematic deep learning pipeline:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: It starts by loading a dataset of MRI images and resizing them to a uniform dimension suitable for the model.

Data Augmentation: To improve model robustness and prevent overfitting, it generates new training samples by applying random transformations (like rotation and flips) to the existing images.

Model Building: It constructs a CNN from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras, featuring layers designed to extract features from the images.

Training: The model is trained on the augmented dataset, learning to differentiate between images with and without tumors.

Evaluation: Its performance is measured using metrics like accuracy and loss on a separate test set to validate its effectiveness.

Prediction: Finally, the trained model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen MRI images.

üìÇ Dataset
The model is trained on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. The dataset contains two folders:

yes: MRI images that contain brain tumors.

no: MRI images that do not contain brain tumors.

You will need to download this dataset and place it in your Google Drive to run the notebook.

üß† Model Architecture
The model is a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network built with Keras. The architecture consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layer (Conv2D): 32 filters, kernel size (3,3), ReLU activation.

Max Pooling Layer (MaxPooling2D): Pool size (2,2).

Convolutional Layer (Conv2D): 32 filters, kernel size (3,3), ReLU activation.

Max Pooling Layer (MaxPooling2D): Pool size (2,2).

Flatten Layer: To convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.

Dense Layer: 512 neurons, ReLU activation.

Output Layer (Dense): 1 neuron, Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary_crossentropy as the loss function.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine or in a cloud environment like Google Colab.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

pip (Python package installer)

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git](https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git)
cd brain-tumor-detection

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

üèÉ How to Run
The project is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment due to its use of Google Drive for dataset storage and free access to GPUs.

Upload the Notebook: Upload the brain_tumour_detection_using_deep_learning.ipynb file to your Google Colab workspace.

Prepare the Dataset:

Download the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset.

Create a folder in your Google Drive (e.g., Brain-Tumor-Detection).

Upload the downloaded brain_mri_images_for_brain_tumor_detection.zip file into that folder.

Update File Path: Open the notebook and make sure the path in the cell that unzips the file points to the correct location in your Google Drive.

# Example path, change if necessary
zip_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Brain-Tumor-Detection/brain_mri_images_for_brain_tumor_detection.zip'

Run the Cells: Execute the notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom.

The first cell will ask for permission to mount your Google Drive.

Subsequent cells will load and process the data, build the model, train it, and show the results.

üìä Results
After training, the notebook will output the following:

Training & Validation Plots: Graphs showing the model's accuracy and loss over each epoch.

Model Accuracy: The final accuracy score on the test dataset.

Predictions: Examples of predictions on sample images from the dataset, indicating whether a tumor is detected or not.
