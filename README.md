Overview
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach for brain tumor detection from MRI images. It serves as an educational tool for data scientists and researchers interested in medical imaging AI. The model uses a CNN to classify images, following a standard pipeline: data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation. While intended for research, it showcases a methodology that could be adapted for future clinical tools.

Dataset
The model is trained on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle, which contains images labeled as yes (with tumor) and no (without tumor). You will need to download this dataset to run the project.

Model Architecture
A Sequential CNN with the following key layers:

Conv2D + MaxPooling2D: Two sets of these layers to extract features.

Flatten: Converts 2D features to a 1D vector.

Dense: A fully connected layer with 512 units (ReLU activation).

Output Layer: A single Dense unit with Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The model uses the Adam optimizer and binary_crossentropy loss.

Setup and Usage
Prerequisites: Python 3.7+, pip, and Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (recommended).

Clone & Install Dependencies:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git](https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git)
cd brain-tumor-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare Dataset:

Download the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset.

Upload the dataset zip file to a folder in your Google Drive.

Run in Colab:

Upload the .ipynb file to Google Colab.

Mount your Google Drive and update the file path in the notebook to point to your dataset zip file.

Execute the cells sequentially.

Results
The notebook visualizes the training/validation accuracy and loss. It also reports the final model accuracy on the test set and shows prediction examples on sample images.
